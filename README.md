# This was a quick react application using vite as a starting point 

Here i showcase my skills as a react developer

I created different branchs that relate a specific concept then each one of them was commited to the main branch

To start clone the repository and then run npm i, on your console.
You need to setup a basic **firebase** account and use ur specific URL to then create a **.env** file where you need to specify **VITE_FIREBASE_URL**

After this run npm run dev to start your application
